                    I'm Brian, a Full Stack developer with a deep, ever-growing
                    interest in cloud technology, languages (both computer and
                    human!), and impactful ideas that empower societies and the
                    individuals therein. I have a B.A. in International
                    Management and, prior to programming, worked in
                    transnational companies in both business development and
                    adminstrative capacities. I also speak Mandarin
                    Chinese(çœŸçš„!)! <br />
                    <br />
                    In the Autumn of 2018 I decided to chase my dream of
                    becoming a software developer, and took the leap by joining
                    <a href="http://lambdaschool.com" target="_blank">
                      {" "}
                      Lambda School
                    </a>
                    . After successfully completing the program(!), I applied to
                    become a part-time Project Manager (a student mentor/TA
                    role) to work with a small group of students as they study
                    algorithms and computer architecture with the aid of Python
                    and C! It's been an amazing journey.
                    <br />

                    If you're reading this, then there's a high likelihood
                    (higher than if you weren't, at leastðŸ¤­) that there's some
                    work we could be doing together! I'm currently available for
                    both short-term contracts and full-time work, and am excited
                    to take all kinds of projects; from building small scale
                    applications for individuals or SMEs, to working on and
                    contributing to large scale codebases. <br />
                    If my skills may be of service to your cause, I look forward
                    to connecting. <br />
                    <br />
